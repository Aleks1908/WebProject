# Aleksandar Ivanov's WebProject

## Project Description

 The web project is based on the JS framework React and I have used vite to setup the project. I have implemented each component of the site in a different file so that i can reuse them in the mobile version. I have used a JSON file to store all data. For categorising/filtering and sorting of the products I have implemented functions that receive all the data from the JSON file and display only the items from the set category. Additionally every-time there is a change in the filter or sort menus the items will be refreshed and you will see the new filtered/sorted items. 

## Project challenges

 One of my main challenges was to think how to make the components in order for them to work on both mobile and desktop with small modifications. Also the filtering and sorting mechanism was a challenge but I was able to make it.

## How to setup the project

```

 cd (pathToProject)/WebProject/npm install

 npm run dev
